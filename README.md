# Spatial Patterns Underlying Facility Location Problems: Visualization and Classification

## Description
The code allows visualizing spatial point patterns underlying facility location instances by inferring representative coordinates for candidates and customers in a 2-dimensional space based on the transport cost matrix. Based on these coordinates the spatial point pattern can be classified as clustered, random, or evenly distributed.
