# Spatial Patterns Underlying Facility Location Problems: Visualization and Classification

## Description
The code allows visualizing spatial point patterns underlying facility location instances by inferring representative coordinates for candidates and customers in a 2-dimensional space based on the transport cost matrix. Based on these coordinates the spatial point pattern can be classified as clustered, random, or evenly distributed.

## Example 

The file [data/example.json](data/example.json) contains the transport cost matrix from instance *cap131* from the ORLIB cap dataset available under [https://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/capinfo.html](https://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/capinfo.html)

Running [GetCoordinates.py](GetCoordinates.py) will provide you with coordinates producing the spatial point pattern below: 

![Spatial point pattern - cap131 ORLIB instances](plots/example.png)

*Notice, that the data set was originally based on a US dataset and that the spatial distribution of the points resembles the distribution of cities on a US map. However, be aware that the MDS output is not deterministic, and different random states will produce different results.*

Running [InferSpatial.py](InferSpatial.py) on the above spatial point pattern will classify the underlying spatial point pattern in the area of the convex hull as **clustered**, indicating that the average nearest neighbor distance is less than what would be expected if the points were distributed randomly.
